        Patients who have agreed in the course of other research studies to have their records
        reviewed will have the following elements evaluated from their existing records: age,
        history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, antiretroviral therapy (ART)
        history and viral loads prior to informed consent, or else these elements will be assessed
        after informed consent. All blood draws to assess eligibility will be completed after
        obtaining informed consent. To participate in this study the criteria listed below will
        need to be met.

          1. Subjects must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Able and willing to provide written informed consent

          3. Must have a history of documented HIV infection.

          4. HIV infection if not previously documented at host institutions will need to be
             documented by a plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral
             load, rapid HIV test or any other licensed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
             test and confirmed by another test using a different method such as a rapid HIV test,
             Western Blot, HIV culture, HIV antigen, HIV pro-viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at
             any time prior to study entry.

          5. ART- treated subjects who are virologically suppressed for greater than or equal to 3
             years (1095 days). To meet this criteria all documented viral loads in the 3 years
             (1095 days) prior to the screening visit must be below the lower limit of detection
             [LLD] using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved standard assays (i.e. <50
             copies/mL) with the following clarification: In each of the three prior years,
             subjects experiencing a single blip [i.e. viral loads above the lower limit of
             detection, LLD] may be included provided they satisfy the following criteria: the
             blips are below 200 copies/ml, and the blip is surrounded (i.e the preceding and
             succeeding viral loads) by undetectable HIV-1 RNA level measurements. That is all
             viral loads must be below LLD EXCEPT for up to one blip. In any 12 month period.

          6. Viral RNA level < 50 c/ml at Screen 1.

          7. A minimum of 2 HIV-1 RNA levels that are below the lower limit of detection using
             standard assays will be required during the 12 month period prior to their screening
             visit. As assay characteristics across the sites can vary, LLD for the assay will be
             used to define whether or not a subject is suppressed.

          8. Stable dose of statin therapy for 6 months if receiving statin therapy.

          9. No known allergy or contraindication to the use of rifamycin compounds such as
             rifampin, rifabutin or rifaximin. .

         10. The effect of rifaximin on the developing human fetus are unknown, therefore subjects
             must be willing to use two methods of contraception (one of which must be a barrier
             method) during the study period. Adequate methods of birth control include: tubal
             ligation, hysterectomy, condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicide;
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; intrauterine device; any of the methods
             that require a prescription (such as contraceptive pills or patch, Norplant,
             Depo-Provera, and others) or a male partner who has previously undergone a vasectomy.

        The following elements will be assessed with a blood draw and after obtaining informed
        consent.

          1. Absolute Neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 750/mm(3)

          2. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 g/dL for women and Hemoglobin 11.0 g/dl for
             men

          4. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) >60 mL/min, eGFR will be calculated using
             the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation

          7. Negative urine pregnancy test of child bearing potential at randomization

          8. No evidence of active hepatitis B or hepatitis C (active hepatitis B will be defined
             as a positive hepatitis B surface antigen present on a single determination, whereas a
             positive result on hepatitis C RNA will be considered as evidence of active hepatitis
             C)

             composition to HDACI, TLR-agonist, or patients with known history of pre-existing

             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             HDACI, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with HDACI and

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effect of ficlatuzumab on the
             developing fetus remains unknown and that cytarabine is a pregnancy risk category D
             drug with known teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because of the potential adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ficlatuzumab and
             cytarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued while on study. Patients who become
             pregnant while on study will be removed from the study once the pregnancy is
