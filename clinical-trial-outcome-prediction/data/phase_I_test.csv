             ionizing radiation in the past year if the total cumulative exposure from the past
             research studies and the current research study would exceed the limits described by
             the FDA in 21 CFR 361.1. Specifically, the total cumulative dose to the whole body,
             active blood-forming organs, lens of the eye, and gonads must remain below 5 rems, and
             the cumulated dose to all other organs must remain below 15 rems over the last year.

                  their future medical care.

               -  Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or commits
                  continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the duration of the
                  study or is willing to use two methods of birth control, one highly effective
                  method and one additional effective method at the same time, at least 4 weeks
                  before starting carfilzomib and bendamustine therapy, during carfilzomib and
                  bendamustine therapy and for at least 4 weeks after stopping carfilzomib and
                  bendamustine therapy. Highly effective methods are hormonal contraceptives (birth
                  control pills, injections, and implants), intrauterine device, tubal ligation and
                  partner's vasectomy. Additional effective methods are condom, diaphragm, and

             12 months (or equivalent dosing of alternate corticosteroids) without complete
             resolution of signs and symptoms or if not improving on any line of therapy beyond
             steroids or if treating physician feels that increasing or adding steroids is not in
             the patient's best interests. Note that the dose of systemic steroids can certainly be
             lower than 0.25 mg/kg/day at enrollment.

          -  Stable dose of corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., calcineurin
             inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil) for 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The

          -  Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dl, AST < 5x ULN), unless hepatic
             dysfunction is a manifestation of cGVHD. For patients in whom a diagnosis of hemolysis
             or Gilbert's is made, the total bilirubin is allowed to be elevated. For patients with
             abnormal LFTs above the thresholds, documented cGVHD on liver biopsy will be required
             prior to enrollment.

                  be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment. If it is
                  essential that the patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only
                  pravastatin may be used with extra caution.

                  initiation of study treatment. NB: Muscular activities, such as strenuous
                  exercise, that can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels should be
                  avoided whilst on LDE225 treatment.

          -  Patients who have taken part in an experimental drug study within 4 weeks or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, of initiating treatment with LDE225.

          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have a narrow
             therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with
             LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with LDE225. Note that patients who require antifungal prophylaxis are
             preferred to be on fluconazole, and, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole who
             must continue are excluded from the dose escalation phase of the study. Once the MTD
             is established, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole will be allowed to enroll
             but at a dose adjustment to be determined before the expansion phase opens.

             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test (> 5 mIU/mL).

          -  Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study
             and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and
                  through 6 months after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either:

               -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients, the
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient]

               -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

                    -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal
                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    -  Barrier method of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                    -  Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed to count as contraception as it cannot be ruled out that the
                       study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Patients
                       are able to continue taking oral contraceptives if desired.

                    -  Note: Woman are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing
                       potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea
                       with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
                       vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH
                       levels > 40 mIU/mL and estradiol < 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral
                       oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the
                       case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman
                       has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
                       not of child bearing potential

               -  Male patient must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception
                  (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and
                  continue using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months
                  following the study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized
                  men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent
                  delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid

               -  Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while
                  taking the study drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications
                  and agree not to father a child in this period.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

        A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

        Step 1 inclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load. [NOTE: The term ""licensed"" refers to a FDA-approved kit, which is required for
             all IND studies.] WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control
             and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
             use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive
             initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an
             E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle
             (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load.

          -  A documented confirmation of acute HCV infection within 6 months prior to A5327 entry
             or HCV reinfection as described below:

               1. Acute HCV infection was defined as meeting one of the following criteria and
                  exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X upper
                       limit of normal (ULN) OR >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in
                       the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or
                       no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA
                       excluding those with any prior positive anti-HCV. OR

                    -  Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative anti-HCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA
                       within the preceding 6 months.

               2. Acute HCV reinfection was defined by documentation of clearance of prior
                  infection (as evidenced by positive anti-HCV Ab) either spontaneously or after
                  treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one
                  of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute
                  hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR
                       >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months
                       or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT
                       baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR

                    -  Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months.

          -  HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable >12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute
             HCV and still within the <24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV
             infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection was defined as date of first
             elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion
             and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurred less
             than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant
             was required a pre-entry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks
             from the first laboratory evidence of infection had passed. It was optimal for this
             pre-entry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory
             evidence to ensure timely treatment. Potential participants who entered screening but
             who had an undetectable HCV RNA (<LLOQ TND) at the pre-entry visit (when required)
             exhibited evidence of possible spontaneous clearance and will not meet the entry
             criteria.]

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m^2

          -  Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically significant abnormalities as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Men and women age ≥ 18 years.

          -  All participants agreed not to participate in a conception process (eg, active attempt
             to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). [NOTE:
             Female candidates who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not eligible. A male
             candidate who had a pregnant female partner was not eligible for the study.]

          -  When participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all participants
             must agree to use at least two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while
             receiving protocol-specified medications, and for 6 months after stopping the
             medications. Such methods included:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  Persons with tumors known to have biomarkers predictive of resistance to erlotinib
             therapy (specifically Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [KRAS] mutations,
             anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] gene rearrangements, and EGFR T790M
             mutations) will be ineligible for study participation; if the results of molecular
             studies are not available or known at the time of study registration and subsequently
             become available, such participants will be considered eligible and if deriving
             clinical benefit may continue receiving erlotinib at the discretion of the
             investigator and study chair

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent
             glioblastoma or an advanced solid tumor in which bevacizumab has shown benefit in
             specific disease population and for which standard or curative measures do not exist
             or are no longer effective

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for non-GBM tumors and by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology

          -  For stage 1 (all patients) and dose expansion (stage 2) endometrial and ovarian cancer
             cohorts, participants are allowed following unlimited prior therapy; for stage 2 GBM
             participants, no more than 2 prior relapses are allowed; for these patients, relapse
             is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo if that
             was used as initial therapy) or a subsequent therapy; the intent therefore is that GBM
             patients enrolling onto stage 2 had no more than 3 prior therapies (initial and
             treatment for 2 relapses); if the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed

                  diagnosis of glioblastoma will be considered the first relapse; therefore, these
                  participants may have had more than 3 prior therapies

          -  Patients must have recovered from clinically significant toxicity of prior therapy to
             grade =< 1 or pre-treatment baseline; the following intervals from previous treatments

             pattern of drinking that results in harm to one's health, interpersonal relationships,
             and ability to work. Binge drinking will be defined as at least one episode of
             consuming more than five units in men and four units in women during the previous
             month. One unit of alcohol can generally said to be a half pint of beer, a single

             SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; FCBP must also agree to
             ongoing pregnancy testing; men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact
             with a FCBP, even if they have had a successful vasectomy; a FCBP is a sexually mature
             woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has
             not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had

               1. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of

                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier method of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                       Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the
                       effectiveness of hormonal contraception.

                       Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential
                       if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels >40
                       mIU/mL and estradiol <20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                       (with or without hysterectomy) at least six week ago. In the case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                       child bearing potential.

             Unless required by local regulations, patients are not required to have HIV, HCB, or
             HCV assessments at screening if these assessments have not been previously performed.

             Patients who are positive for anti-HBc are eligible only if testing is also positive
             for Hepatitis B surface antibody [HbsAb] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is
             negative for HBV DNA.

             of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other anti-inflammatory
             corticosteroids. Stable use (i.e., no change in dose within 1 month prior to Day 1 of
             Cycle 1) of inhaled corticosteroids is allowed.

         16. Prior bone marrow transplant or extensive radiotherapy to greater than 25% of bone
             marrow within eight weeks.

             whilst taking part in this Phase I study. Participation in an observational trial
             would be acceptable.

         18. Current malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately treated
             cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have undergone potentially curative
             therapy for a prior malignancy, have no evidence of that disease for 3 years or more
             and are deemed at negligible risk for recurrence, are eligible for the trial.

         19. Patients who require daily supplemental oxygen

         20. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a

         14. (Continued from Criteria 13) In case of use of oral contraception, women should have
             been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives
             are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception
             due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction. Women are considered post-menopausal
             and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)
             amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
             vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without

         17. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             nonsterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception from the time of screening, and must have agreed to continue using such
             precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the
             last dose of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male partners of a
             female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a
             responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the
             trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods
             of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or postmenopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females < 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

             Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) conducted during screening
             and a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy test conducted prior to study drug administration
             on Day -31. Ongoing serum pregnancy tests were conducted according to the study
             protocol.

             Nonsterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after the last dose
             of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of
             a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             the period described above. Cessation of birth control after this point should have
             been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the
             total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice;
             however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not
             acceptable methods of contraception.

             Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout this period. A
             highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

         18. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         19. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment or for 6 months following the last tremelimumab
             treatment, whichever was longer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy for pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma prior to entering the study.

          2. Pathologic subtypes other than pure adenocarcinoma; acinar cell carcinoma, squamous
             cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine cancer, and mixed types are not
             eligible.

          3. Patients who are receiving any investigational agents.

          4. Patients with borderline resectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.

          5. History of allergic reactions attributed to 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan or

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, active liver disease including viral or non-viral hepatitis and cirrhosis,
             chronic diarrhea or inflammatory disease of the colon or rectum, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. mFOLFIRINOX is a regimen containing more
             than one chemotherapy agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with mFOLFIRINOX, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.

          8. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with mFOLFIRINOX. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          9. Currently active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix. Patients are not considered to have a ""currently active""
             malignancy if they have completed therapy and have no evidence of recurrence for at
             least 5 years.

         10. Pre-existing neuropathy greater than grade 1.

         11. Inflammatory bowel disease that is uncontrolled or on active treatment (Crohn's
             disease, ulcerative colitis).

             continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of investigational
             products. Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms
             plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point
             should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females <50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy,
                  bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

             Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational products. Male
             subjects were to refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. Female partners
             (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method
             of contraception (see table below) throughout this period. Cessation of birth control
             after this point was to be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in
             sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the

             A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g. male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation was not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

             antigen result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive 1/2
             antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved hepatitis B virus infection (defined as
             the presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen) were eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C antibody were eligible only
             if polymerase chain reaction was negative for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid.

             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24
             hours prior to the start of nivolumab. Women must not be breastfeeding. Men who are
             sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of
             less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP
             will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last
             dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e.,

             to adhere to contraception for a period of 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required
             for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational
             product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of
             the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that
             WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active

             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Nivolumab is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with Nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with Nivolumab.

             or equal to 2.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the
             following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication
             until 2 weeks after the last dose of study medication: a) Vasectomy with documentation
             of azoospermia. The documentation on male sterility can come from the site
             personnel's: review of subject's medical records, medical examination and/or semen
             analysis, or medical history interview. B) Male condom. The allowed method of
             contraception is only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance
             with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects
             understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Female of non-reproductive potential (FNRP) is eligible to participate in this study
             if she meets at least one of the following conditions: a) Females with one of the
             following procedures documented and no plans to utilize assisted reproductive
             techniques (e.g., in vitro fertilization or donor embryo transfer): bilateral tubal
             ligation or salpingectomy, hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up
             confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral Oophorectomy
             (surgical menopause); b) Post-menopausal women including Females 60 years of age or
             older, A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an
             appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, more than 45 years, in the
             absence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or medical suppression of the menstrual
             cycle (e.g., leuprolide treatment). In questionable cases for women less than 60 years
             of age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol
             falling into the central laboratory's post-menopausal reference range is confirmatory
             (these levels need to be adjusted for specific laboratories/assays. Females fewer than
             60 years of age, who are on HRT and wish to continue, and whose menopausal status is
             in doubt, should not be enrolled in this study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most
             forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and
             the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can enroll into the study and
             resume use of HRT.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator, influence the outcome of the trial in the 4 weeks before baseline visit
             and during the trial.

             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
             (e.g., exposure to sunlight other than that associated with usual daily activities,
             use of tanning booth, etc.) within 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit or intention to
             have such exposure during the study, thought by the investigator likely to modify the
             subject's psoriasis.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator or physician performing the initial examination the
             subject should not participate in the clinical trial, e.g. due to probable
             noncompliance, inability to understand the trial and give adequately informed consent,
             or inability to complete the Psoriasis Symptom Diary.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Ga-68-DOTA-TOC have the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of
             Ga-68-DOTA-TOC to mothers, breastfeeding mothers are also excluded from this study.

             underlying risk factors such as cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis B or C infection.
             Patients with prior local liver directed therapy such as TACE, Ablation, Y-90 or
             hepatectomy surgery for HCC are eligible if they have developed a new untreated lesion
             in the liver which can be targeted for a biopsy. Patients who have had prior systemic

             and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients may not be receiving any other concurrent anti-cancer therapy.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other concurrent investigational agents.

          3. Patients taking medications with a narrow therapeutic index including warfarin,

          7. Child Pugh Class B (8,9) and Class C are excluded

          8. Antiviral therapy for HCV and HBV is allowed, but patient should not be on interferon.

          9. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with meclizine.

         10. Patient must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to
             registration, cardiac arrhythmia, glaucoma, asthma or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because meclizine is a Class B agent with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with meclizine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with meclizine.

          -  Prior palliative radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to first
             dose of study drug. Subjects with symptomatic tumor lesions at baseline that may
             require palliative radiotherapy within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug are
             strongly encouraged to receive palliative radiotherapy prior to enrollment.

          -  Reproductive Status: Rucaparib caused post-implantation loss (100% early resorptions)
             at all doses administered in an embryo-fetal development study. Based on its mechanism
             of action, nivolumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
             Pregnant women are therefore not eligible for this study.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy
                  test result less than 3 days prior to administration of the first dose of
                  rucaparib.

               -  WOCBP must not be considering getting pregnant during the study.

               -  WOCBP and their male partners must agree to use a highly effective, reliable form
                  of contraception during treatment; for 6 months following the last dose of
                  rucaparib; and for at least 5 months following the last dose of nivolumab.

               -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use a highly effective,
                  reliable form of contraception during treatment; 6 months following the last dose
                  of rucaparib; and for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab .

               -  In addition to the above methods of contraception, use of a condom by male
                  patients is recommended to prevent transfer of drug through semen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,
             type I diabetes, mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only
             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, childhood
             asthma that is not currently active, or conditions not expected to recur in the
             absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

          -  Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration except for adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg
             daily prednisone equivalent in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Note:
             Treatment with a short course of steroids (< 5 days) up to 7 days prior to initiating
             study drug is permitted.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Prior exposure to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, other immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g.
             anti-LAG-3, and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies), or PARP inhibitors.

          -  Patients with a ""currently active"" second invasive malignancy other than non-melanoma
             skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a ""currently active"" malignancy if
             they have completed therapy and have been free of disease for ≥ 1 years.

          -  Patients with known and untreated or progressing brain metastases are excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated with
             surgery and/or radiotherapy and are without evidence of progression on scan for at
             least 4 weeks, and are off steroids or antiseizure medications, will be eligible .

          -  Patients with symptomatic or impending spinal cord compression are not eligible unless
             appropriately treated.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to nivolumab or rucaparib.

          -  Based on in vitro CYP interaction studies, caution should be used for concomitant
             medications with a narrow therapeutic window that are substrates of CYP2C19, CYP2C9,
             and/or CYP3A. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication is recommended. Caution
             should also be exercised for concomitant use of certain statin drugs (e.g.
             rosuvastatin and fluvastatin) due to potential increase in exposure from inhibition of
             BCRP and CYP2C9. An updated list of clinically relevant P450 drug interactions (e.g:
             Flockhart Table http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/) should be
             reviewed while screening patients for study.

               -  Patients taking warfarin should have international normalized ration (INR)
                  monitored regularly according to standard institutional practices

               -  Because rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp in vitro, caution should be
                  exercised for patients receiving rucaparib and requiring concomitant medication
                  with digoxin. Patients taking digoxin should have their digoxin levels monitored
                  after starting rucaparib and then regularly per standard clinical practice.

          -  Patients on parenteral nutrition are not eligible. Patients must not have a
             pre-existing duodenal stent or any gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in
             the opinion of the treating investigator, interfere with absorption of rucaparib.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, requirement for
             oxygen therapy, ongoing or active infection other than minor urinary tract infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Known history of chronic hepatitis B or C as evidenced by:

               -  Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen

               -  Positive test for qualitative hepatitis C viral load (by polymerase chain
                  reaction [PCR])

               -  Note: Subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody and negative quantitative
                  hepatitis C by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are eligible.

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             rucaparib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Adverse effect of prior therapy not improved to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or below with the exception of alopecia or lymphopenia.
             Ongoing Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity (e.g. neuropathy) related to most recent
             treatment regimen may be permitted with prior advanced approval from the Lead
             Principal Investigator.

          -  Initiated denosumab or bisphosphonate therapy or adjusted denosumab or bisphosphonate
             dose/regimen within 4 weeks prior to first dose of rucaparib. Patients on a stable
             denosumab or bisphosphonate regimen are eligible and may continue treatment.

          -  Evidence or history of active or latent tuberculosis infection including purified
             protein derivative (PPD) recently converted to positive.

          -  Use of non-oncology vaccines containing live virus for prevention of infectious
             diseases within 12 weeks prior to study drug. The use of inactivated seasonal
             influenza vaccines, e.g., Fluzone®, will be permitted on study without restriction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has MM and:

               1. Has received prior ASCT after standard first-line induction treatment.

               2. Has evidence of PD, with progression-free interval ≥6 months in Phase 1 ≥18
                  months in Phase 2.

                  Progression Free Interval is defined as the time from date of ASCT to PD.

               3. Received treatment with ≤3 prior lines of therapy. A line of therapy is defined
                  as 1 or more cycles of a planned treatment program. When patients have undergone
                  sequential phases of treatment without intervening progression, such as
                  induction, collection of peripheral blood stem cells, transplantation and
                  consolidation/maintenance, this is considered to be 1 line of treatment. A new
                  line of therapy is initiated as a result of PD or relapse (Garderet et al, 2017).

             second collection. (Note that, although not required, in Phase 1, the Investigator
             should consider enrolling patient with a large number of available PBSCs to permit
             subsequent ASCT, as patients in Stage 1 may received a dose lower than that determined
             to be effective.)

          5. Age 18-75 years.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score <3 at Screening.
