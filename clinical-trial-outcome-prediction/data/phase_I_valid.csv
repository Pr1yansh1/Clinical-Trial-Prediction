             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20

             tyrosine-kinase inhibitors for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. In

             able to receive adequate enteral nutrition by mouth or through a G-tube device.

         11. The effects of RAD001 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. For this reason and because agents used in this trial are known to
             be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to RAD001 or other agents used in the study.

          5. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             the isoenzyme CYP3A are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances known
             or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A isoenzymes are provided in the
             appendix.

          6. Patients receiving chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive
             agents are ineligible.

          7. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycin
             (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or its excipients.

          8. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g. ulcerative disease; uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection).

          9. Patients with active bleeding diathesis or patients on oral anti-vitamin K agent
             (excluding low dose warfarin).

         10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, severely impaired lung function or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements Severely impaired lung function is
             defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and /or O2
             saturation that is 88% or less on room air.

         11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RAD001 is a mTOR inhibitor with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with RAD001, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.

         12. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RAD001. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
