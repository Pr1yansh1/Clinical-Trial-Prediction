        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have center-involved macular edema secondary to CRVO. Eyes may be
             enrolled as early as the time of diagnosis of the macular edema. The definition of
             CRVO used in SCORE will also be used for the purposes of SCORE2: a CRVO is defined as
             an eye that has retinal hemorrhage or other biomicroscopic evidence of retinal vein
             occlusion (e.g., telangiectatic capillary bed) and a dilated venous system (or
             previously dilated venous system) in all 4 quadrants.

          -  Due to the similarities of a hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO) to CRVO,HRVO will be
             classified as CRVO for the purposes of this clinical trial. Eyes classified as having
             a HRVO will be limited to no more than 25% of the planned sample size. A HRVO is
             defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhage or other biomicroscopic evidence of
             retinal vein occlusion (e.g. telangiectatic capillary bed) and a dilated venous system
             (or previously dilated venous system) in 5 or more clock hours but less than all 4
             quadrants. Typically, a HRVO is a retinal vein occlusion that involves 2 altitudinal
             quadrants.

          -  E-Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)visual acuity score of greater
             than or equal to 19 letters (approximately 20/400) and less than or equal to 73
             letters (approximately 20/40) by the ETDRS visual acuity protocol. The investigator
             must believe that a study eye with visual acuity between 19 and 33 letters is
             perfused.

          -  Retinal thickness on SD-OCT measurement, defined as central subfield thickness of 300
             µm or greater. If the SD-OCT measurement is taken from a Heidelberg Spectralis
             Machine, the central subfield thickness should be 320 µm or greater.

          -  Media clarity, pupillary dilation and participant cooperation sufficient for adequate
             fundus photographs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., chronic alcoholism or drug abuse, personality disorder or use of
             major tranquilizers indicating difficulty in long term follow-up, likelihood of
             survival of less than 12 months).

          -  Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of study entry that involved
             treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at time of study
             entry.

          -  History of allergy to any anti-VEGF agent, corticosteroid, or component of the
             delivery vehicle.

          -  The participant will be moving out of the area of the clinical site to an area not
             covered by another clinical site during the 12 months of the study.

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test: all women of childbearing potential (those who are
             pre-menopausal and not surgically sterilized) may participate only if they have a
             negative urine pregnancy test, and if they do not intend to become pregnant during the
             timeframe of the study. Women who are sexually active with a male partner must agree
             to use at least one of the following birth control methods: hormonal therapy such as
             oral, implantable or injectable chemical contraceptives; mechanical therapy such as
             spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or diaphragm; intrauterine
             device (IUD); or surgical sterilization of partner.

          -  Women who are breast-feeding.

          -  Examination evidence of vitreoretinal interface disease (e.g., vitreomacular traction,
             epiretinal membrane), either on clinical examination or OCT thought to be contributing
             to macular edema.

          -  An eye that, in the investigator's opinion, would not benefit from resolution of
             macular edema such as eyes with foveal atrophy, dense pigmentary changes or dense
             subfoveal hard exudates.

          -  Presence of an ocular condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect
             macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., age-related
             macular degeneration, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular
             glaucoma, iris neovascularization, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, prior macula-off
             rhegmatogenous retinal detachment).

          -  Presence of a substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely
             to be decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., a 20/40 cataract).

          -  History of laser photocoagulation for macular edema within 3 months prior to
             randomization.

          -  History of intravitreal corticosteroid within 4 months of randomization.

          -  Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection within 2 months of randomization. Note: Enrollment
             will be limited to no more than 25% of the planned sample size with any history of
             anti-VEGF treatment. Once this number of eyes has been enrolled, any history of
             anti-VEGF treatment will be an exclusion criterion. For enrollment of study eyes with
             prior intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, in the opinion of the investigator, the treatment
             response to prior anti-VEGF treatment must be either incomplete or the study eye had

             subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.
             For this definition, ""documented"" refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the
             subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview
             with the subject or from the subject's medical records. Double barrier method: condom
             and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal
             agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)

          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of >=10 pack-years at screening (visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those
             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe and/or
             cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history

          -  Severity of COPD symptoms: A score of >=10 on the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at
             screening

             and a documented history of >= 2 moderate exacerbations or a documented history of >=1
             severe COPD exacerbation (hospitalized) in the previous 12 months. Note: Percent
             predicted will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung
             Function Initiative reference equations. Note: A documented history of a COPD
             exacerbation (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record of worsening COPD
             symptoms that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a
             moderate exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of
             antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use was
             associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnea,
             sputum volume, or sputum purulence (color). Subject verbal reports are not acceptable

             affecting control of the upper airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia
             Gravis). Patients at potentially high risk (e.g. very low BMI, severely malnourished,
             or very low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the Investigator

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening and at least 30 days following the last dose of
             oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable). In addition, any subject that
             experiences pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run-in
             period will be excluded

          -  Other Respiratory tract infections that have not resolved at least 7 days prior to
             screening

          -  Abnormal Chest x-ray(CXR): Chest x-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence
             of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the
             presence of COPD, or another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an
             infiltrate on CXR (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All
             subjects will have a chest x-ray at Screening Visit 1 (or historical radiograph or
             computerised tomography (CT) scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening) that
             will be over-read by a central vendor. Note: Subjects who have experienced pneumonia
             and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation within 3 months of screening must provide
             a post pneumonia/exacerbation chest x-ray to be over-read by the central vendor or
             have a chest x-ray conducted at screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or
             CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to
             conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained from the Federal Office for
             Radiation Protection (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz [BfS])

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding:
             Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The Principal
             Investigator will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in
             relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue
             risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding
             that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing
             that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial fibrillation
             (AF) with rapid ventricular rate >120 beats per minute); sustained or nonsustained
             ventricular tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third
             degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted); QT interval
             corrected for heart rate (QTcF) >=500 milliseconds (msec) in patients with QRS <120

             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator
             contraindicates study participation

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy >3 Liter/minute (L/min) (Oxygen use =<3L/min flow is not exclusionary)

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study

          -  Affiliation with investigator site: Study investigators, sub-investigators, study
             coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate
             family members of the aforementioned that is involved with this study

          -  Inability to read: In the opinion of the Investigator, any subject who is unable to
             read and/or would not be able to complete study related materials

          -  Medication prior to screening: Use of the following medications within the following

        Criteria for Randomization:

        Patients were randomized into the study if they met all of the following criteria:

          1. The patient continued to be in general good health, meeting the entry criteria.

          2. The patient continued to have a predose/pre-albuterol FEV1 at the randomization visit
             (RV) that was ≥40% of predicted normal.

          3. The patient had no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results or ECG
             findings at the screening visit.

          4. The patient had no significant changes in asthma medications during run-in, excluding
             the albuterol/salbutamol HFA (90 mcg ex actuator) or equivalent used as rescue
             medication as supplied per protocol.

          5. The patient did not have a upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or lower
             respiratory tract infection (LRI) during the run in period. Patients who developed a
             URI or LRI during the run in period could be discontinued from the study and allowed
             to re-screen 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms.

          6. The patient had no asthma exacerbation during the run in period, defined as any

             oropharyngeal candidiasis.

          8. The patient did not experience an adverse event that would result in failure to
             continue to meet selection criteria.

          9. The patient did not use any of the prohibited concomitant medications during the run
             in period.

         10. The patient complied with completion of the daily diary, defined as follows:

             may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis
             or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer
             in remission for <5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has
             been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Chest X-Ray: A chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals evidence of
             clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A
             chest X-ray must be taken at Visit 1 if a chest X-ray or CT scan is not available
             within 6 months prior to Visit 1.

             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as of narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the study physician
             contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled anticholinergic.

             12-lead ECG conducted at Visit 1, including the presence of a paced rhythm on a
             12-lead ECG which causes the underlying rhythm and ECG to be obscured. Investigators
             will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist
             to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. Specific ECG findings that precluded
             subject eligibility are as listed. An ECG finding that would preclude a subject from
             entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not
             limited to, any of the following: Sinus tachycardia ≥120 bpm*Note: sinus tachycardia
             ≥120bpm should be confirmed by two additional readings at least 5 minutes apart. Sinus
             bradycardia <45bpm*Note: Sinus bradycardia <45bpm should be confirmed by two
             additional readings at least 5 minutes apart.Multifocal atrial
             tachycardia.Supraventricular tachycardia (>100bpm).Atrial fibrillation with rapid
             ventricular response (rate >120bpm). Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response
             (rate >120bpm). Ventricular tachycardias (non sustained, sustained, polymorphic, or
             monomorphic). Ventricular flutter. Ventricular fibrillation. Torsades de Pointes.

             AV dissociation. Trifascicular Block. For subjects with QRS duration <120 ms: QTc(F)
             ≥450msec or an ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (e.g., poor defined
             termination of the T wave). For subjects with QRS duration>120: QTc(F) ≥480msec or an
             ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (e.g., poor defined termination of the T
             wave). Myocardial infarction (acute or recent) * Note: Evidence of an old (resolved)
             myocardial infarction is not exclusionary. The study investigator will determine the
             medical significance of any ECG abnormalities not listed above.

             infections (such as tuberculosis), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary
             conditions. A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other
             significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples
             may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension,
             sarcoidosis, or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Any subject who is considered unlikely to survive the
             duration of the study period or has any rapidly progressing disease or immediate
             life-threatening illness (e.g. cancer). In addition, any subject who has any condition
             (e.g. neurological condition) that is likely to affect respiratory function should not
             be included in the study.

          -  Severe Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class
             C) should be excluded unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the benefit is
             likely to outweigh the risk.

          -  Moderate to severe Renal Impairment: Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment
             (e.g., end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis) should be excluded, unless in the
             opinion of the investigator, the benefit is likely to outweigh the risk.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: Long-acting muscarinic antagonists
             (LAMAs) should be used with caution in subjects with severe cardiovascular disease. In
             the opinion of the investigator, use should only be considered if the benefit is
             likely to outweigh the risk in conditions such as: Myocardial infarction or unstable
             angina in the last 6 months; Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring
             intervention in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association Class IV heart failure

          -  Contraindications: Any history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, sympathomimetic, lactose/milk protein
             or magnesium stearate.

          -  Antimuscarinic effects: Subjects with medical conditions such as narrow-angle
             glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction should
             only be included if, in the opinion of the study physician, the benefit outweighs the
             risk.

          -  Hospitalization: Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit
             1.

          -  Lung Resection: Lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG): Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews
             conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject
             eligibility. The Investigator will determine the clinical significance of each
             abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects
             who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Subjects with the following
             abnormalities are excluded from participation in the study: Atrial fibrillation with
             rapid ventricular rate >120 beats per minute; Sustained or nonsustained ventricular

             For this definition, ""documented"" refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the
             subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview
             with the subject or from the subject's medical records.; Double barrier method: condom
             and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal

          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of >10 pack-years at Screening (Visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those
             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe and/or
             cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

             Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Severity of Disease: Subjects must demonstrate at Screening: <a post-bronchodilator
             FEV1 <50% predicted normal OR a post-bronchodilator FEV1 <80% predicted normal and a
             documented history of >=2 moderate exacerbations or one severe (hospitalized)
             exacerbation in the previous 12 months. Subjects must also have a measured post

             will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function
             Initiative reference equations. Note: A documented history of a COPD exacerbation
             (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record of worsening COPD symptoms
             that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a moderate
             exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics
             alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use was associated with
             treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or
             sputum purulence (colour). Subject verbal reports are not acceptable.

          -  Existing COPD maintenance treatment: Subject must be receiving daily maintenance
             treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to Screening. Note: Subjects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant
             during the study.

          -  Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD). Alpha1-antitrypsin
             deficiency: Subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of
             COPD.

          -  Other respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer,
             significant bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension,
             interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases.

          -  Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior
             to Screening.

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. Human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV], Lupus) or other risk factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders
             affecting control of the upper airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia
             Gravis). Subjects at potentially high risk (e.g. very low Body mass index [BMI],
             severely malnourished, or very low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of
             the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening and at least 30 days following the last dose of
             oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable). In addition, any subject that
             experiences pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run-in
             period will be excluded.

          -  Respiratory tract infection that has not resolved at least 7 days prior to Screening.

          -  Abnormal Chest X-ray (CXR): Chest X-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence
             of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the
             presence of COPD, or another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an
             infiltrate on CXR (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All
             subjects will have a CXR at Screening Visit 1) (or historical radiograph or Computed
             Tomography [CT] scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening) that will be
             over-read by a central vendor. Note: Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or
             moderate or severe COPD exacerbation within 3 months of screening must provide a post
             pneumonia/exacerbation CXR to be over-read by the central vendor or have a CXR
             conducted at Screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3
             months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic
             CXR will need to be obtained from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. For subjects taking part in the
             physical activity monitor subset: Orthopaedic, neurological or other complaints that
             significantly impair normal biomechanical movement patterns and limit the ability to
             walk/cycle, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,
             cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or

             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the

             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding:
             Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The Principal
             Investigator (PI) will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG
             finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: Atrial
             fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate >120 Beats Per Minute (BPM); sustained
             or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type
             II and third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted);
             QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >=500 milliseconds
             (msec) in subjects with QRS <120 msec and QTcF >=530 msec in subjects with QRS >=120
             msec.

             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy >3litres/minute (L/min) (Oxygen use <=3L/min flow is not exclusionary.)

             Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program within 4 weeks prior to Screening or subjects who
             plan to enter the acute phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program during the study.
             Subjects who are in the maintenance phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program are
             not excluded.

          -  Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug
             abuse within the last 2 years.

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit
             compliance for scheduled visits.

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Affiliation with investigator site: study investigators, sub-investigators, study
             coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate
             family members of the aforementioned that is involved with this study.

          -  Inability to read: In the opinion of the investigator, any subject who is unable to
             read and/or would not be able to complete study related materials.

          -  Medication prior to screening: No use of the following medications within the
             following time intervals prior to Screening or during the study. Long term antibiotic
             therapy: Subjects receiving antibiotics for long term therapy are not eligible for the
             study (Antibiotics are allowed for the short term treatment of an exacerbation or for
             short term treatment of other acute infections); Systemic, Oral, parenteral
             corticosteroids: 30 days (Except during the study oral/systemic corticosteroids may be
             used to treat COPD exacerbations/pneumonia). Intra-articular injections are allowed.
             Any other investigational drug: 30 days or 5 half lives whichever is longer.

             might confound the results of safety assessments conducted in the study or that might
             increase risk to the subject. Similarly, the subject will be excluded if he or she has
             any additional condition(s) that, in the Investigator's opinion, would prohibit the
             subject from completing the study or would not be in the best interest of the subject.
             The additional conditions would include any significant illness or unstable medical
             condition that could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol. Mild, stable

          9. Subject has a known history of hypertension

         10. Subject has a known history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, advanced
             arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
             abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may
             place him/her at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant
             medication.

         11. Subject has a known family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia.

         12. Subject has any clinically significant ECG or clinically significant laboratory
             abnormality at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).

         13. Subject has current abnormal thyroid function, defined as abnormal thyroid stimulating
             hormone and thyroxine at the Screening Visit (Visit 1). Treatment with a stable dose
             of thyroid medication for at least 3 months is permitted.

         14. Subject has a documented allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to amphetamine or
             to any excipients in the investigational product.

             course(s) (dose and duration) of amphetamine therapy

         16. Subject has a history of suspected substance abuse or dependence disorder (excluding
             nicotine) in accordance with DSM-IV-TR criteria. Subjects with a lifetime history of
             amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant abuse and/or dependence will be excluded.

         17. Subject has a positive urine drug result at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) (with the
             exception of subject's current stimulant therapy, if any) or the Baseline Visit (Visit
             2), if repeated unless the Investigator can verify that the positive result at the
             Screening Visit (Visit 1) is attributed to medication that has been prescribed to the
             subject and will be discontinued prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 2). A positive
             result at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) attributed to a prescribed medication requires
             a re-test and a negative result at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) to confirm subject
             eligibility.

         18. Subject has taken another investigational product or has taken part in a clinical
             study within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1).

         19. Subject has previously completed, discontinued, or was withdrawn from this study.

         21. Subject is required to take or anticipates the need to take medications that have
             central nervous system effects or affect performance, such as sedating antihistamines
             and decongestant sympathomimetics, or are monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Stable use of
             bronchodilator inhalers is not exclusionary.

         22. Subject is female and is pregnant or lactating

             cigarettes per day divided by 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per
             day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are
             defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Screening
             (Visit 1). Note: Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

          -  Severity of COPD symptoms: A score of >=10 on the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at
             Screening (Visit1).

          -  Severity of COPD Disease: A post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.70 at
             Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Existing COPD maintenance treatment: Subject must be receiving daily maintenance
             treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). Note:
             Subjects receiving only as needed COPD medications are not eligible.

          -  History of Exacerbations: Subjects must demonstrate: a post-bronchodilator FEV1 <50
             percent predicted normal at Screening (Visit 1) and a documented history of >=1
             moderate or severe COPD exacerbation in the 12 months prior to Screening or a
             post-bronchodilator 50 percent =< FEV1 <80 percent predicted normal at Screening
             (Visit 1) and a documented history of >=2 moderate exacerbations or a documented
             history of >=1 severe COPD exacerbation (hospitalised) in the 12 months prior to
             Screening (Visit 1). Notes: Percent predicted will be calculated using the European
             Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations; A documented
             history of a COPD exacerbation (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record
             of worsening COPD symptoms that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or
             antibiotics (for a moderate exacerbation) or hospitalisation (for a severe
             exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation
             history unless the use was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD,
             such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence (colour). Subject
             verbal reports are not acceptable.

          -  French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study
             only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant
             during the study.

          -  Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD, which is the primary
             cause of their respiratory symptoms).

          -  Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency: Subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency as the
             underlying cause of COPD.

          -  Other respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis are excluded. Subjects
             with other respiratory disorders (e.g. clinically significant: bronchiectasis,
             sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases) are
             excluded if these conditions are the primary cause of their respiratory symptoms.

          -  Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery (including procedures such
             as endobronchial valves) within the 12 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. advanced human immune deficiency
             virus (HIV) with high viral load and low cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count,
             Lupus on immunosuppressants that would increase risk of pneumonia) or other risk
             factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis). Notes: Subjects at a high
             risk for pneumonia (e.g. very low body mass index (BMI), severely malnourished or very
             low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening (Visit 1) and at least 30 days following the last dose of
             oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable).

          -  Other Respiratory tract infections that have not resolved at least 7 days prior to
             Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Abnormal Chest x-ray: Chest x-ray reveals evidence of pneumonia or a clinically
             significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD, or another
             condition that would hinder the ability to detect an infiltrate on chest x-ray (e.g.
             significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All subjects will have a
             chest x-ray at Screening (Visit 1) [or historical radiograph or computerised
             tomography (CT) scan obtained within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). Notes:
             Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation
             within 3 months of Screening (Visit 1) must provide a post pneumonia/exacerbation
             chest x-ray or have a chest x-ray conducted at Screening (Visit 1); For sites in
             Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is
             not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained
             from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BFS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Unstable liver disease: ALT >2 times upper limit of normal (ULN); and bilirubin >1.5
             times ULN (isolated bilirubin >1.5 times ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin <35 percent). Current active liver or biliary
             disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or
             otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). Notes: Stable
             chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of ascites,
             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or
             persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis; Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g., presence of
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test result at
             screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the
             last 6 months; Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention
             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 4 Heart failure.

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead ECG finding: Investigators will be
             provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to
             assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The investigator will determine the
             clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's
             medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in
             the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding that would preclude a
             subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted
             as, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid
             ventricular rate >120 beats per minute (BPM); sustained or nonsustained ventricular
             tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third degree heart
             block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted).

          -  Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid,
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the investigator
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 3
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 3 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy >3 Liters per minute (Oxygen use <= 3 Liters/minute flow is not exclusionary.)

          -  Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their
             albuterol/salbutamol for the 4-hour period required prior to spirometry testing at
             each study visit.

          -  Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug
             abuse within the last 2 years.

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit
             compliance for scheduled visits.

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Affiliation with investigator site: Study investigators, sub-investigators, and study
             coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate
             family members of the aforementioned that is involved with this study.

          -  Inability to read: In the opinion of the investigator, any subject who is unable to
             read and/or would not be able to complete study related materials.

          -  Medication prior to Screening: Use of the following medications within 30 days prior
             to Screening (Visit 1) or requirement for their use during the study: Use of long term
             continuous antibiotic therapy; systemic, oral, parenteral corticosteroids
             (Intra-spinal and intra-articular injections are allowed); use of any other
             investigational drug: within 30 days or 5 half lives whichever is longer.

             interventions) less than 1 month prior to screening, or is receiving behavioral
             therapy and in the opinion of the investigator will not be able to follow a stable
             routine for the duration of the study. Note: Unavoidable changes in school-based
             interventions that occur during study participation will not be exclusionary, but
             should be documented by the investigator, to the extent possible.

             screening. Note: Subjects with a positive UDS may be allowed to continue in the study,
             provided that the investigator determines that the positive test is as a result of
             taking medications as prescribed after consultation with the medical monitor.

             28. Subject is taking any disallowed medications for chronic treatment. 29. Subject
             has previously been enrolled in a clinical trial of dasotraline (SEP-225289).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Oral anticoagulant (OAC) indication for atrial fibrillation for a period of at least
             12 months following successful PCI with stenting.

        Eligibility is assessed 4 hours after sheath removal and within 5 days after successful PCI
        with stent placement. If a staged PCI is planned, eligibility is assessed after completion
        of the last stage.

        Successful PCI definition:

        The success of a PCI procedure is defined by 2 interrelated components: angiographic
        findings, procedural / clinical outcomes as detailed below:

        Angiographic Success A minimum stenosis diameter of < 20% (as visually assessed by
        angiography - residual blockage or stenosis reduced to less than 20% of the artery's
        diameter).

        Sufficient enlargement of the lumen at the target site to improve coronary artery blood
        flow with final thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 (visually
        assessed by angiography), without occlusion of a significant side branch, flow-limiting
        dissection, distal embolization, or angiographic thrombus.

        Procedural Success No major in-hospital clinical complications(e.g. ongoing International
        Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [ISTH] major or clinical relevant non-major
        procedural bleeding at the time of randomization, stroke, emergency coronary artery bypass
        graft [CABG]).

        In summary, a clinically successful PCI requires both anatomic and procedural success along
        with relief of signs and/or symptoms of myocardial ischemia at the time of randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bleeding risks or systemic conditions

          -  Known bleeding diathesis, including but not limited to,

               1. Uncontrolled active bleeding, encompassing both ISTH major and clinically
                  relevant non-major bleeding, preceding randomization.

                  Lesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding.
                  This may include but is not limited to: unresolved gastrointestinal ulceration,
                  presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding (e.g. malignancies with
                  metastasis), recent unresolved brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or
                  ophthalmic surgery, any intracranial hemorrhage, known or suspected esophageal
                  varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms (of more than 3.5 cm) or
                  major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities.

               2. Medication-related

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) > 2.5 (the participant can be reconsidered at a
             later time, but within 5 days of sheath removal).

          -  Contraindication to edoxaban, VKA, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and/or P2Y12
             antagonists;

          -  Concomitant treatment with other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy and
             chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

             of the predicted normal value at Visit 1. Predicted values will be based upon the
             European Respiratory Society (ERS) Global Lung Function Initiative.

          -  Reversibility of Disease: airway reversibility defined as >=12% and >=200 milliliter
             (mL) increase in FEV1 between 20 and 60 minutes following 4 inhalations of
             albuterol/salbutamol aerosol at Visit 1.

          -  If the subject does not meet the above reversibility criteria at Visit 1 then the
             reversibility assessment may be repeated once within 7 days of Visit 1 if either
             criteria a) or b) are met: a) >=9% increase in FEV1 between 20 and 60 minutes
             following 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol aerosol at Visit 1. b) Documented

        albuterol/salbutamol aerosol) at the second attempt then, provided that all other
        eligibility criteria assessed at Visit 1 are met, the subject may enter the 3-week run-in
        period.

          -  Short-Acting beta2 Agonists (SABAs): All subjects must be able to replace their
             current SABA inhaler with albuterol/salbutamol aerosol inhaler at Visit 1 as needed
             for the duration of the study. Subjects must be judged capable of withholding
             albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 hours prior to study visits.

          -  Male or eligible Female, defined as having documentation of non-reproductive potential
             or reproductive potential as follows:

        A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a
        negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, is not planning on
        becoming pregnant during the study and at least one of the following conditions applies:
        Non-reproductive potential defined as pre-menopausal females with documented tubal ligation
        or documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of
        bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented bilateral oophorectomy;
        Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
        profile (e.g., age appropriate, >45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy).
        In questionable cases for women <60 years of age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
        stimulating hormone and estradiol falling into the central laboratory's postmenopausal
        reference range is confirmatory. Females under 60 years of age, who are on hormone
        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, are required to use a
        highly effective method to avoid pregnancy if they wish to continue their HRT during the
        study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status
        prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between
        the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
        of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, subjects can resume use of
        HRT during the study without use of a highly effective method to avoid pregnancy;
        Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List
        of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential

             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure.

          -  Antimuscarinic effects: Subjects with a medical condition such as narrow-angle
             glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction should
             only be included if in the opinion of the Investigator the benefit outweighs the risk
             and that the condition would not contraindicate study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written, signed consent for trial participation must be obtained from the patient
             appropriately in accordance with applicable International Conference on Harmonization
             (ICH) guidelines and local and regulatory requirements prior to the performance of any
             study specific procedure.

          2. Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced pancreatic ductal
             adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that is metastatic. The definitive diagnosis of metastatic PDAC
             will be made by integrating the histopathological data within the context of the
             clinical and radiographic data. Patients with islet cell neoplasms are excluded.

          3. Must not have previously received chemotherapy or any investigational agent for the
             treatment of PDAC. A fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabine administered as a radiation
             sensitizer in the adjuvant setting is allowed for as long as last dose was
             administered > 6 months prior to randomization and no lingering toxicities are
             present.

          4. Nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine therapy is appropriate for the patient and recommended
             by the Investigator.

          5. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors evaluable by CT scan with contrast (or MRI,
             if patient is allergic to CT contrast media) per RECIST 1.1. Imaging investigations
             including CT/MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis or other scans as necessary to document all
             sites of disease must be performed within 14 days prior to randomization. Qualifying
             scans performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of the study
             informed consent will be acceptable as baseline scanning as long as scanning is
             performed < 14 days prior to randomization.

          6. Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1,
             assessed within 14 days prior to randomization. Two observers qualified to perform
             assessment of the performance status will be required to perform this assessment. If
             discrepant, the one with the most deteriorated performance status will be considered
             true.

          7. Must have life-expectancy of > 12 weeks.

          8. Must be ≥ 18 years of age. Due to increased risk of sepsis in patients >80 years old,
             candidate patients in this age group should be thoroughly evaluated prior to study
             randomization to ensure they are fit to receive chemotherapy. In addition to all of
             the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed, clinical judgment should be used regarding
             patients' susceptibility to infection (including but not limited to presence of
             ascites or diabetes mellitus increasing risk of infection). Furthermore, the expected
             stability of their performance status while receiving repeat weekly chemotherapy
             cycles should be given special attention. Patients in this age group should not be
             randomized on the study should there be any hesitation on any of these considerations.

          9. For male or female patients of child producing potential: Must agree to use
             contraception or take measures to avoid pregnancy during the study and for 180 days

               3. Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated clearance > 60 mL/min/1.73
                  m^2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional
                  normal value. If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be used
                  for calculating creatinine clearance (eg. Using the Cockcroft-Gault formula). For
                  patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m^2, lean body weight should be
                  used instead.

             prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of care prior
             to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable as baseline
             laboratory work as long as testing is performed < 14 days prior to randomization) as
             demonstrated by prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) below or
             within normal limits (+15%).

             appropriate for the anti-coagulation indication.

         14. Patient has no clinically significant abnormalities on urinalysis results (obtained <
             14 days prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of
             care prior to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable
             as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is performed < 14 days prior to
             randomization).

         15. Patient must have adequate nutritional status with Body Mass Index (BMI) > 18 kg/m^2
             and body weight of > 40 kg with serum albumin > 3 g/dL.

         16. Baseline laboratory evaluations must be done within 14 days prior to randomization and
             some must be repeated < 72 hours prior to randomization.

             fixed paraffin block of tumor tissue in order that the specific correlative marker
             assays (Correlative Studies) of this protocol may be conducted. Submission of the
             tissue does not have to occur prior to randomization. Where local center regulations
             prohibit submission of blocks of tumor tissue, two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block
             and 5-20 unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue are
             preferred. Where it is not possible to obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block,
             5-20 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are also acceptable. Where no
             previously resected or biopsied tumor tissue exists or is available, on the approval
             of the Sponsor/designated CRO, the patient may still be considered eligible for the
             study.

         20. Patient must consent to provision of a sample of blood in order that the specific
             correlative marker assays (Correlative Studies) may be conducted.

         21. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must receive protocol treatment and be followed at the participating center.
             This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits placed on patients being
             considered for this trial. Investigators must ensure that the patients randomized on
             this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, response
             assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.

         22. Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 calendar days of patient randomization for
             patients randomized to Arm 1. Patients randomized to Arm 2 must begin protocol
             treatment within 7 calendar days of randomization.

         23. The patient is not receiving therapy in a concurrent clinical study and the patient
             agrees not to participate in other interventional clinical studies during their
             participation in this trial while on study treatment. Patients participating in

                       test.

             Note: ESL may interfere with the action of hormonal contraceptive and therefore
             hormonal contraceptives are not sufficient for this protocol.

             degree of understanding of the local language at a level sufficient to complete study
             related assessments or communicate suitably with the Investigator and study
             coordinator. For subjects who do not meet this criterion, a caregiver must be able to

             excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV
             infection is required; participants who are anticipated to require HCV treatment
             within 12 months must be excluded. (HCV treatment on study may be permitted post Week
             52, following consultation with the medical monitor).

          -  Subjects with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into this study if: liver enzymes
             meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, and is not
             advanced, and will not require treatment prior to the Week 52 visit. Additional
             information (where available) on participants with HCV co-infection at screening
             should include results from any liver biopsy, Fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis
             evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior
             treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment; In the event that recent biopsy or
