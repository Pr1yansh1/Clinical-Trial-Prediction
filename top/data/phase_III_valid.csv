             cannot be the only pathologic criteria to confirm clear cell RCC. Patients with tumor
             types that are interpreted as non-clear cell, e.g. papillary, are excluded.

          -  Locally advanced RCC (defined as disease not amenable to curative surgery or radiation
             therapy) or metastatic RCC (equivalent to Stage IV RCC according to American Joint
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging.

          -  Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic
             nature must be confirmed by histology or cytology. Cytology cannot be the only
             pathologic criteria to confirm clear cell RCC, but can be used in a patient with
             histologically confirmed clear cell RCC to confirm that metastatic disease is
             neoplastic in nature.

          -  Must have measurable disease, i.e. presenting with at least one measurable lesion per
             Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A measurable lesion is defined
             as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest
             diameter ≥ 20 mm using conventional techniques, or ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Note: Patient should be excluded if all baseline measurable lesions are within
             previously irradiated areas.

          -  Note: A patient must complete all the baseline disease assessments in order to be
             eligible. Baseline head, chest, abdominal and pelvic CT or MRI scans must be performed
             within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication; baseline bone scan must be
             performed within 3 weeks of the first dose of study medication.

          -  Patients who have received only one prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or
             metastatic RCC with documented disease progression or documented treatment
             discontinuation due to unacceptable toxicity. This first-line systemic treatment must
             be cytokine based.

          -  Note: The first-line cytokine-based treatment can be interleukin-2 (IL-2) or
             interferon-α (INFα) monotherapy, IL-2 in combination with INF-α, IL-2 and/or INF-α in
             combination with chemotherapy, hormonal or other therapies excluding agents targeting
             angiogenesis pathways. Agents in a combination regimen can be given sequentially if
             the treatment sequence is pre-determined and the patient does not fail one agent prior
             to starting another.

          -  Note: Prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapies are permitted excluding any agents that
             target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptors. The
             adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapies should not be considered as first-line systemic
             treatment for advanced RCC.

        Or,

          -  Patients who have received no prior systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic RCC can
             be enrolled if under any of the following circumstances:

          -  Patients who live in countries or regions where there is no established standard
             first-line therapy for advanced/metastatic RCC or where there are barriers to the
             access of established therapies such as sunitinib, sorafenib, IFNα or IL-2.

          -  Patients who live in countries or regions where IL-2 or INF-α has been approved for
             the treatment of advanced/metastatic RCC, however, these agents are generally not
             recognized by the local clinical community as a standard treatment for
             advanced/metastatic RCC, or where the physician and the patient have determined that
             the available cytokine therapies are not an acceptable therapeutic option.

          -  Patients who have recurred following prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant cytokine therapy
             for RCC are eligible to participate without receiving a first-line systemic treatment
             for locally advanced or metastatic RCC. These patients should be stratified as the
             first-line population.

          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  A woman is eligible to participate in the study if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),
             including any female who:

          -  Has had a hysterectomy,

          -  Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy),

          -  Has had a bilateral tubal ligation,

          -  Is post-menopausal (total cessation of menses for ≥1 year).

          -  Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks of the
             first dose of study medication, and agrees to use adequate contraception. GSK
             acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both
             the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follows:

          -  An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

          -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female patient's entry and is the
             sole sexual partner for that female.

          -  Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to
             investigation product, through the clinical trial, and for at least 21 days after the
             last dose of investigational product.

          -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or
             film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

          -  Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to the potential for drug-drug interactions.

          -  A man with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to enter and
             participate in the study if he is abstinent or uses a barrier method of contraception
             during the study.

        determined by 24-hour urine protein analysis.

          -  Note: A patient should first be screened with dipstick urinalysis. If urine protein is
             ≥2+, then a 24-hour urine protein must be assessed and patient will be excluded if
             24-hour urine protein is≥ 1.0 gram.

          -  Corrected serum calcium level within normal range per local clinical laboratory
             standard.

                       registration

                    -  (For the purposes of the nomogram calculator, the last PSA value recorded
                       prior to the initiation of treatment will be considered the baseline PSA)

          -  Patients with stable (CCS 1-4) or unstable angina pectoris (but with the most recent
             anginal episode occurring >48 hours before the procedure) or documented silent
             ischemia

          -  Stable Hemodynamic conditions (systolic BP > 100 HR > 40 < 100).

          -  No clinical and ECG changes suggestive of ongoing acute or recent (<48 hours)
             myocardial infarction.

             overlapping with a total stent length > 33 mm and reference vessel diameter between
             2.5 and 4.0 mm (by visual estimation) in one coronary vessel. Multiple lesions in the
             same vessels can be included but at least one lesion should require implantation of
             two DES in overlapping with a total stent length > 33 mm. The definition of
             multivessel disease requires an intention to treat at least two lesions (with a least
             one with the characteristics reported above) in two different major epicardial
             segments. For example, the presence of a lesion in the left anterior descending artery
             and in the obtuse marginal or the presence of a lesions in the right postero-lateral
             branch and in a diagonal branch will qualify as multivessel. The presence of lesions
             in the left anterior descending artery and in the diagonal branch will not qualify as
             multivessel. Bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions can be included, but only if at
             least two DES in overlapping with a total stent length > 33 mm are implanted in the
             same branch. When treating diffuse lesion in the same vessel, overlapping stenting is
             recommended with high pressure (>14 atm post-dilation) of the overlap zone. There is
             no maximum stent length to treat one coronary vessel.
