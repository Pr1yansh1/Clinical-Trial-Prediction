             uncontrolled congestive heart failure,and cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection
             fraction, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because carboplatin, paclitaxel, cetuximab
             and radiation therapy have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with the above agents, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with the agents used in this study. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible

                  epirubicin, fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin on a developing
                  human fetus are not well-known. Because the risk of toxicity in nursing infants
                  secondary to cetuximab, cisplatin, epirubicin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and
                  oxaliplatin treatment of the mother is unknown but may be harmful, breastfeeding
                  must be discontinued.

          6. No myocardial infarction < 6 months prior to registration or New York Heart

             greater risk of irinotecan toxicity due to the abnormal glucuronidation of SN-38, the
             active metabolite of irinotecan. Evidence of Gilbert's Syndrome would include
             documentation of elevation of indirect bilirubin at any time in the patient's medical
             history.

         10. Required Initial Laboratory Data:

             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other toxicities.

          -  History of allergy to platinum compounds, capecitabine, sorafenib or to antiemetics
             appropriate for administration in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy.

             bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study because oxaliplatin,
             capecitabine and sorafenib is a DNA alkylating agent with the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Female patients of reproductive potential must

          -  Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first
             study drug.

          -  Because of drug interactions with sorafenib, use of St. John's Wort or rifampin
             (rifampicin) is contraindicated. Patients may discontinue the use of these drugs to
             become eligible for the study

        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to
        allow participants and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace
        the advice of a personal physician or health professional.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women >/= 18 years of age.

          -  Histologically proven breast cancer with an interval between definitive breast surgery
             that includes axillary lymph node (LN) dissection or axillary nodal evaluation and
             study registration of < 60 days. (Note: Cycle 1 of chemotherapy treatment may NOT be
             infused until > 28 days after the date of definitive breast surgery and the
             participant must be recovered from any clinically significant toxicity thereof.)

          -  Definitive surgical treatment must be either mastectomy, or breast conserving surgery
             with axillary lymph node dissection (axillary lymph node evaluation can be either full
             axillary node dissection or sentinel LN evaluation followed by dissection if sentinel
             LN is positive) for operable breast cancer (pT1-4 [including inflammatory], pNO-3, and
             MO). Margins of resected specimen from definitive surgery must be histologically free
             of invasive adenocarcinoma and ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). Lobular carcinoma
             in-situ does not count as a positive margin.

          -  Subjects must be either lymph node-positive (pN1-3) or lymph node-negative (pN0) with
             high-risk features as determined by Investigator.

          -  High-risk, lymph node-negative participants, (pN0) will be defined as subjects having
             invasive adenocarcinoma with either a negative sentinel node biopsy (pN0[sn]) OR
             negative lymph node dissection (pN0) disease AND tumor size > 2 cm or tumor size >/= 1
             cm with at least one of the following factors:

               -  negative estrogen receptor (ER) and negative progesterone receptor (PR) status

               -  histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2-3; or

               -  age < 35 years

          -  HER2/neu positive or negative tumors are eligible. HER2 positivity must be documented
             by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

          -  Estrogen and progesterone receptor status must be performed on the primary tumor prior
             to study entry. Results must be pending or known at the time of study entry.

          -  Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
             or shortening fraction (multiple-gated acquisition [MUGA] scan or echocardiography
             respectively). The result must be greater than the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the
             institution.

          -  Hematology evaluation within 2 weeks prior to study entry:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >/= 1,500/μL

               -  Platelets >/= 100,000/μL

               -  Hemoglobin >/= 9 g/dL

          -  Hepatic function evaluation within 2 weeks prior to study entry:

               -  Total bilirubin </= ULN for the institution

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must be in
                  the acceptable range.

          -  Complete staging work-up as follows: All subjects must have an appropriate
             radiographic evaluation, e.g., computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography
             (PET)/CT, and/or (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI of the brain, chest, abdomen and
             pelvis, and imaging of bone by either a bone scan or PET scan. In cases of positive
             bone imaging, a bone X-ray or MRI evaluation is mandatory to rule out the possibility
             of metastatic bone scan disease. Other tests may be performed as clinically indicated.
             It is recommended that all baseline staging should be completed within 35 days prior
             to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or prevention
             of breast cancer. Subjects must have discontinued these agents prior to study entry.

          -  Concurrent treatment with ovarian hormonal replacement therapy. Prior treatment must
             be stopped prior to study entry.

          -  Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. Participation in another clinical
             trial with any investigational non-marketed drug within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because OSI-774 has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk

             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with OSI-774 or other agents administered during the
             study; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

             medical monitor alone or in consultation with one or more of the study Principal
             Investigators.

          -  All patients must have photography at screening. Canfield Scientific Inc. will provide
             centralized monitoring, tracking, and collection of patients' photographs throughout
             the study. Screening photographs must be uploaded to the Canfield Scientific Inc
             website and approved by Canfield Scientific Inc, as the central photography vendor.
             The photographs, along with the completed Inflammatory Breast Cancer Skin Assessment
             Tool (IBSAT), must be reviewed and approved by GSK before a patient can be randomized.
             Sites should allow a minimum of 3 business days for this process. Sites submitting
             quality photographs and IBSATs on a regular basis will receive an exemption from this
             requirement for future patients.

          -  Patients with secondary IBC are eligible.

          -  Measurable lesions (cutaneous or radiographic) may be in the field of prior standard
             or palliative radiation therapy; however, there must be at least a 4 week period

        count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for
        screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified in the
        protocol.

        Note: Informed consent may be obtained prior to the protocol-specified screening window
        (i.e. Day -14 to Day -1).

             estradiol value < 40pg/mL (<140 pmol/L).

        Patients must discontinue HRT prior to study enrollment due to the potential for inhibition
        of CYP enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins (See Section 8). For most forms of
        HRT, at least 2-4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and determination of
        menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. If a
        female patient is determined not to be post-menopausal, they must use adequate
        contraception, as defined immediately below.

        Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test
        within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first
        dose as possible, has used adequate contraception since the pregnancy test and agrees to
        use adequate contraception as described below. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when
        used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the
        physician, are as follow:

          -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or
             film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

        Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug drug interactions.

        Female patients who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of
        investigational product and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and
        for 14 days following the last dose of investigational product.

             The average QTc from the three screening electrocardiograms (ECGs) must be less than
             480 msec in order for the patient to be eligible for the study).

             Patients who are receiving a drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation (see Appendix C,

             or tolerate further diarrhea.

             Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZD6474 is an anti-angiogenic agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with ZD6474, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with ZD6474.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be female.

          -  The patient must be greater than/equal to 18 years old

          -  The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core
             needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.

          -  Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease (American Joint
             Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging criteria) with a primary breast tumor that is
             greater than/equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has
             inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.

          -  Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication.

          -  The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0
             or 1.

               -  Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm^3.

               -  Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.

          -  The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:

               -  total bilirubin must be less than/equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the
                  lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5
                  x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of
                  bilirubin; and

               -  alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the
                  lab.

               -  Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example,
                  if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x
                  ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than
                  the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be
                  less than/equal to ULN.

          -  Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN
             but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone
             scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic
             disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if
             suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI), or biopsy.

          -  Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion
             in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not
             demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.

          -  The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met:

               -  Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min.

          -  Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.

          -  Patients must have their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by
             multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study
             entry. The LVEF must be greater than/equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the
             cardiac imaging facility performing the MUGA scan or echocardiogram. Note: If the
             cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.

        Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF
        assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and
        cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an
        accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the
        MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two
        LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.

          -  Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within 3 months prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tumor determined to be strongly HER2-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by
